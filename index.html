                <p>Before it became a global phenomenon, Minecraft started as a small indie project by Swedish programmer Markus "Notch" Persson in 2009. Inspired by games like *Infiniminer*, Notch wanted to create a world where players had total freedom to build and destroy. What started as a simple "Cave Game" made of pixelated blocks evolved into the best-selling video game of all time. It taught us that you don’t need ultra-realistic graphics to create an infinite universe—all you need is a pickaxe and your imagination</p>

                <p> Fortnite had a long and surprising journey. Developed by Epic Games, it was first announced in 2011 as a cooperative survival game called *Save the World*, where players built forts to fight off monsters. However, everything changed in 2017. Inspired by the rising popularity of the Battle Royale genre, Epic Games added a free-to-play 100-player mode. With its unique building mechanics, colorful art style, and epic live events, Fortnite quickly transformed from a simple shooter into a massive cultural phenomenon.</p>

                <p>Roblox is much older than many people think! It was co-founded by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel in 2004, originally under the name *DynaBlocks*, before officially launching as Roblox in 2006. The vision was unique: instead of making a single game, they created a platform where *anyone* could be a developer. Today, it’s a massive "multiverse" with millions of user-created experiences, proving that the best games are the ones we build together.</p>
